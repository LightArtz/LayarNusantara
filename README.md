## 🛠️ Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/LayarNusantara.git](https://github.com/your-username/LayarNusantara.git)
    cd LayarNusantara
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `pnpm`. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via npm: `npm install -g pnpm`.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables. You'll need to create a Supabase project and obtain your keys.

    ```dotenv
    # Supabase Credentials
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" # This is for server-side actions

    # Google Gemini API (for chatbot)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_URL="YOUR_GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT" # e.g., [https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY](https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent?key=YOUR_API_KEY)
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`, `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `YOUR_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and `YOUR_GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT` with your actual Supabase and Gemini API credentials. Ensure your Gemini API endpoint includes your API key directly in the URL as shown in the example comment if you are using it this way.

4.  **Supabase Database Setup:**
    You'll need to set up the necessary tables in your Supabase project. The application primarily uses:
    -   `promotions` table
    -   `promotion_payments` table
    -   `admin_users` table

    Refer to the `app/actions/promotions.ts`, `types/promotion.ts`, and `types/travel-story.ts` files for the expected schema and data structures. You can create these tables and their columns in your Supabase dashboard.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
